## Setting up your web site

Normally this is an assignment to be completed outside of class. We will, however, do this as an exercise/walkthrough.

This is a rare instance where the exercise will count toward your grade. It is worth **10 points.** You will need to complete this by the time your HTML project is due (TBA).

**If you are absent from class, you are advised to follow the instructions below to set up your web site.**

## Instructions

1. Create a new repo on GitHub. Name it `username.github.io` where username is your GitHub username. Type your username exactly as it appears; GitHub is case sensitive. Enter "My web site" as the description. Click "Create repository".

2. Under "Quick setup" click the "Set up in Desktop" button.

3. When GitHub Desktop opens, click "Clone". Remember where you are saving the repo on your computer.

4. In your code editor, create a new file. Save it as `index.html` in the username.github.io directory on your computer. (Why index.html? If there are multiple files on a web site, the server looks for index.html first. Otherwise, it will not know what page to load and return an error.)

5. Create a simple web page. Build the document structure: a doctype, html, head and body tags. Add meta and title tags.

6. Add your name wrapped in an `h1` tag and include some content. Write a short paragraph ("This is my first web page!"), perhaps add a list. Add some fun stuff if you would like. It need not be complex, but use the opportunity to practice a little code.

7. Use the `octocat.png` file from the exercise repo. Move (or copy) this file into the username.github.io folder on your computer. Add `octocat.png` to `index.html` using an `img` tag. (Do not forget the alt attribute!)

8. When finished, commit the changes in GitHub Desktop. You should be committing two files: `index.html` and `octocat.png`. Add your summary for the changes, click "Commit to Master", then click "Publish Branch".

9. Return to your web browser. View your username.github.io repository. You may need to refresh the page. The files should appear.

10. Now open a new tab in your browser. Type http://username.github.io (where username is your username) in the URL bar and hit Enter. **Congratulations! You have published your first web page!**

11. When you see your web page is working, please visit the 'Issues' section of `exercise-04`. Click the green 'New Issue' button. Write your name in the title. Post the URL (link) in the comment section.
